"""
This project involves some DNA analysis for a fictional crime investigation.

Case Information:
Three suspects were apprehended by authorites. One of which is believed to be an international spy.
The only evidence is some surveillance video and a small DNA sample retrieved from a computer keyboard.
Each suspect has submitted a DNA sample.
Use the DNA sample retrieved from crime scene and the three DNA samples from the suspects
to determine the spy everyone is looking for.
